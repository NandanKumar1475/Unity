1) What is transform ?
     Every GameObject in Unity has a Transform component.

Transform stores 3 things:

-->
| property   | meaning                              |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `position` | where the object exists in the world |
| `rotation` | how much the object is rotated       |
| `scale`    | size of the object                   |

So when you write transform inside a script → you are talking to that GameObject’s Transform component.

Example:
transform.position gives the position vector (x,y,z)


2) What is Translate() ?

Translate() moves the object to a new position based on a direction vector.

Meaning: Move it from current position by x,y,z values.

It does not teleport.
It shifts position relative to current position.

3) What parameter does Translate() take ?
--> Translate takes a Vector3 as parameter.


Now Question is How can be manipulate the POSITION , ROTATION AND SCALE OF THE GAME OBJECT

-->1POSITION 
  ->get position 
  
   -> Vector3 currentPos = transform.position;
      Debug.Log(currentPos);
  
  ->set position
   transform.position = new Vector3(5, 1, 3);
   
-->2 ROTATION 
  -> get rotation
    Quaternion currentRot = transform.rotation;
    Debug.Log(currentRot);
  ->
   transform.rotation = Quaternion.Euler(0, 90, 0);
   
   --> modify rotation
     transform.Rotate(0, 45 * Time.deltaTime, 0); // rotate gradually
	 
-->3) Scale
 -> get scale
    Vector3 currentScale = transform.localScale;
    Debug.Log(currentScale);
 -> set scale
   transform.localScale = new Vector3(2, 2, 2); // double size
   
  -> modify scale
  transform.localScale += new Vector3(0.1f, 0.1f, 0.1f);


Tip: difference between position and localPosition

   position = world coordinates
   
   localPosition = position relative to parent
   
   same for scale and rotation also
 
 
Notes:

Moves without physics, like teleportation every frame.

Ignores gravity and collisions.

Use in simple prototypes, 2D games, or for non-physical motion (UI, background).
