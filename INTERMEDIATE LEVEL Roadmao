🔥 Excellent move, Nandan!
You’ve built a **solid beginner foundation**, and now you’re ready to step into the **INTERMEDIATE LEVEL** — the stage where you go from “I can make a cube move” ➜ to “I can build complete, real gameplay systems.”

This is where **your game logic, architecture, optimization, and creative systems** begin to grow 🌱

---

## 🎯 GOAL OF INTERMEDIATE LEVEL

By the end of this stage, you’ll be able to:
✅ Build complete game systems (player, enemies, levels, UI, etc.)
✅ Understand physics, animation, and camera blending deeply
✅ Write **clean, reusable C# code** (like a real game dev)
✅ Use **real Unity systems** like Object Pooling, Events, ScriptableObjects
✅ Add **particles, lighting, post-processing, and VFX**
