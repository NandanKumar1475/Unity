-->> 🧩 1  | `transform.Translate()

            using this Methods we can move the GameObject Easily without using any physics 
         -->transform.Translate() means "move the object relative to its current position".
It’s super simple, perfect for learning and for light objects like a flying cube or menu animation.


1) What is transform ?

Every GameObject in Unity has a Transform component.

Transform stores 3 things:

-->   
| property   | meaning                              |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `position` | where the object exists in the world |
| `rotation` | how much the object is rotated       |
| `scale`    | size of the object                   |
