Step 1 – What is a Vector? 
--> 🧍‍♂️ Real-Life Understanding

Imagine:

You are standing at your home 🏠.

The park 🎡 is 5 meters east from you.

You can describe that as:

"Go 5 meters towards the East."

👉 This is a vector — something that tells both direction and distance.

🧩 In Simple Words:------------

A vector = direction + distance (magnitude)
So if I say:
Vector = (5, 0, 0)
It means:
Move 5 units in the X direction (right)
0 in Y (no up/down)
0 in Z (no forward/backward)

Example i Code  : -
public Transform homeObject;
public Transform parkObject;

void Start()
{
    Vector3 home = homeObject.position;
    Vector3 park = parkObject.position;

    Vector3 direction = park - home;

    Debug.Log(direction);
}

Notes:-
This formula ALWAYS remember:
  --> direction = final - initial

2.🧠 Next Step : ---------------

👉 Next Lesson (Step 2): Vector Components (x, y, z)
You’ll learn how Unity’s world works:

X = Left/Right

Y = Up/Down

Z = Forward/Backward

Example :-
new Vector3(0, 0, 5)   // Move 5 units forward
new Vector3(5, 0, 0)   // Move 5 units right
new Vector3(0, 2, 0)   // Move 2 units up
We’ll also create a small visual demo:
